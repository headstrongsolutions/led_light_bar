# Neopixel LED lightbar pattern controller with rotary encoder

...like seriously, that really is pretty much it. There's a simple microcontroller running MicroPython with a string of RGB LEDs (neopixels) and rotary encoder.
Rotate the knob and the pattern changes, press the kbob and it turns the LEDs on or off.

..yup.
